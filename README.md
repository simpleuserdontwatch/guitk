# guitk
have you ever heard about window-in-window? yep, tkinter doesnt have it. but i recreated it for tkinter

# Installing
put guitk.py into your project directory or your local python's Lib directory 

# How to  use
first of all you need to create an `GUI` by typing `gui = guitk.GUI(root)`\
now you can create windows with `mywindow1 = guitk.window(gui)`\
theres also some options for window like `title`, `height`, `width`
